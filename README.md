# Project: On-Device-RL #
## Objective
This project builds an On Device Learning Agent for a Lunar Lander simulation model using RP2350 microcontroller on the Purdue Proton Board and a Spartan 7 FPGA chip on the cmod-s7 board.

## Prerequirements
1) It is very important to get familiar with the [Purdue Proton Board Documents](https://ece362-purdue.github.io/proton-labs/datasheets/). For Summer 2025, I researched this board by doing all the labs experiments that are designed for this board, along with thoroughly reading the datasheet and the SDK files.
2) The second development board I used is the [Cmod s7](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cmod-s7/start?srsltid=AfmBOop_CKo5_TScgHHEjhI1Ipts6waJEYTNX_5fcXB9tujCfTp53HwQ). Would recommend reading through the datasheet for this FPGA too. I also did a small setup project that drives an LED using the FPGA's 12 MHz clock. This project helped me to understand the setup protocols of this chip.
3) Download [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive.html) on your device. This is a very powerful tool used by AMD for Digital Systems Design. To get used to this software, I followed these [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmLQnr2Fjat0WpVSmZ76kkMtSWie2DBpQ).
